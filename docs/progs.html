<H2>RED, CPP and CSTAR</H2>

<P>I have written several programs that have been placed in the public domain.
Among them are RED, CPP and CSTAR. These programs are available on CD ROM
from <A HREF="http://www.hal9k.com/cug/">The C/C++ Users Group</A>:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hal9k.com/cug/v300a.htm#cug318">Volume 318</A> contains
RED, a text editor for MSDOS. RED was originally written in 1983.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hal9k.com/cug/v300a.htm#cug319">Volume 319</A> contains
CPP, an ANSI-Standard C preprocessor. CPP was written in 1987.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hal9k.com/cug/v300c.htm#cug357">Volume 357</A> contains
a compiler for a language I invented called CSTAR. For those of you with
a very long memory, CSTAR is similar to pl/360 but with a C-style syntax.
CPP was written in 1987. It has, at best, historical interest.</P>
