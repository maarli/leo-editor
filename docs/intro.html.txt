Leo is a power tool for people who want to organize, study and work with
data, especially complex data like computer programs, books, web sites and
data bases.

Leo looks like other outlining programs, but it is not. Leonistas say Leo
is a revolutionary tool and that Leo is fun to use--even addictive.

Leo is `free software`_; it's source code is freely available.

This tutorial has two parts: 

1. `Learn the basics of Leo in one hour`_ and
2. `Learn intermediate topics in one hour`_.
