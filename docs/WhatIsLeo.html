<h3><a name="programming"></a>  Leo's outlines add a new dimension to programming</h3>

<p>Leo organizes all aspects of code or data into a visual outline. But
outlines do more than merely organize:</p>
<p>- Outline structure is first class data that can be used by programs or
scripts. All aspects of Leo are fully scriptable using Python scripts embedded
in outlines. In particular, scripts have easy access to the data within
outlines, including all the hierarchical relationships explicitly created by
outlines.</p>
<p>- Outline nodes provide a natural way of associating meta-data
(descriptions of data) with the data themselves. Headlines contain descriptions;
body text contain the actual data. Meta-data is useful to humans as summaries.
More importantly, it is easy to write scripts driven by meta-data.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Leo can generate scripts from outlines using the
standard markup language called <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/">noweb</a>. In other words, scripts not only
<b>use</b>
outline structure, scripts <b>have</b> outline structure.</p>
<p>- One of Leo's plugins creates &quot;script buttons&quot; from special &quot;script nodes&quot; in an outline.
Script buttons appear in an extensible part of Leo's outline window. Script
buttons execute the script in the script node <i>on the presently selected outline
node</i>. That is, <b>script buttons bring scripts to data</b>.&nbsp; You have no idea how cool this is until you try it. For example, one
script button automatically creates unit tests from scripts in the selected
outline without the programmer having to create unit test classes!</p>
<p>There are too many implications to describe here:&nbsp; <i>integrating
outline structure with programming is a fundamental addition to the programming
world</i>. The result is an immensely powerful scripting and programming
environment.</p>

<h3><a name="views"></a>Leo shows you your code, your data the way <i>you</i>
want</h3>

<p>Leo's outlines provide a way of generating arbitrarily many views of
an outline <i>within the outline itself</i>. Users create views with special linking
nodes called clones. Leo updates cloned outlines simultaneously: any change (in
content or structure) made to one clone instantly changes all other clones.</p>
<p>Views are explicit and permanent; they are a powerful tool for
understanding and managing any kind of complex data. For example, views often
represent tasks. Programmers use task views to gather code, notes, test runs and
any other data that is relevant to a programming task. Managers use task views
to gather design notes or to-do lists. Web designers use views to gather parts
of a web site that are of interest.</p>

<h3><a name="lp"></a>Leo extends, completes and simplifies literate programming</h3>

<p>Leo's users can generate arbitrarily many files, called <i>derived files</i> from a single outline. This process is called &quot;tangling&quot; and is
controlled by the noweb markup language. Untangling is the reverse process,
viz., updating a Leo outline from changes made to derived files. Tangling and
untangling happen automatically, so one quickly learns to regard typical source
files as something uninteresting, much as a C programmer would regard machine
language files.</p>

<p>Tangling is the key feature of so-called <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">literate
programming</a> (LP) systems.&nbsp; LP has been around for a long time. It never caught on because LP tools
were hard to use and because LP programs were hard to understand. Leo changes
all that. For the first time, LP becomes easy
to use.</p>

<h3><a name="community"></a>Leo is extensible and dynamic&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Leo has an active community of users; Leo is typically one of the
top 200 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/"> SourceForge</a> projects.&nbsp;People invent new uses for Leo almost every week. Thousands of
people use Leo; many are <a href="testimonials.html"> wildly enthusiastic</a>.</p>

<p> Leo's users contribute greatly to Leo's development.&nbsp;
For example, Leo
has a simple, powerful plugin mechanism that takes full advantage of Python's
dynamic character. This plugin architecture was created by one of Leo's users,
Paul Paterson. Paul has recently written another plugin that manages the dozens
of plugins that Leo's users have contributed.</p>
