The focus is in the tree pane, so I can select the "to do"
node merely by using the Up-Arrow key.

If, for some reason, the focus is in the body pane,
I can select the previous node in either of two ways:

1. Type Alt-T to put focus in the tree pane
   followed by the Up-Arrow key.

2. Type Alt-Up-Arrow.  This selects the previous
   node and also puts focus in the tree pane.

Now the "to do" node is selected.
