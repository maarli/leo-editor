Leo Basics Step By Step:6
=========================


You can use Leo without ever using the mouse. For
instance, you can select any Leo pane by using
keystrokes instead of clicking the pane:

- Regardless of where the focus is, Alt-D puts
  focus in the body pane and Alt-T puts foucs in
  the outline pane.

- With the focus in the tree pane, hitting the
  return key puts the focus in the body pane.
