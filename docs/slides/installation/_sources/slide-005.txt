==================
Setting .leoID.txt
==================


The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique
identifier. This string helps ensure that each Leo node has a
unique identity.

This identifier can be any string 3 characters or more in length.
In a shared environment, a cvs or bzr login name works well.

Pick a string you don't mind making public: it will appear in
files that Leo creates.

Leo stores this identifier in the file ~/.leo/.leoID.txt.
You can change this identifier at any time by editing .leoID.txt.
