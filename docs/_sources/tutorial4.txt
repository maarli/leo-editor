Scripting Leo
+++++++++++++



Leo scripts
***********

Ctrl-B (execute-script) executes the body pane after expanding @others and
section references throughout the tree. The symbols 'c', 'g' and 'p'
are predefined as follows:

- c is the Commander of the outline in which the script is executing.
- g is the leo.core.leoGlobals module.
- p is c.p (the same as c.currentPosition())

These three predefined variables give any Leo script full access to
all methods defined in Leo's source code. Examples::

    c.redraw() # requests redraw of Leo's screen.
    g.es(s) # prints string s to the log window.
    g.app # the singleton instance of the leoApp class.
    g.app.gui # the the singleton instance of the leoGui class.
    g.app.windowList # the list of presently open frames.

    # Returns list of all open commanders
    commanders = [frame.c for frame in g.app.windowList]

For any position p, here are p's getters::

    p.b # p's body text.
    p.h # p's headline.
    p.u # p's uA, the same as p.unknownAttributes.
    p.v # the vnode corresponding to p.
    p2 = p.copy() # p2 is a copy of p.

    # Returning ints:
    
        p.childIndex()
        p.numberOfChildren()
        p.level()

    # Returning bools:
    
        p.hasChildren()
        p.isAncestorOf(v2) # True if v2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
        p.isCloned()
        p.isDirty()
        p.isExpanded()
        p.isMarked()
        p.isVisible()
        p.isVisited()
        
Here are p's most important setters::

    p.b = s  # Sets the body text of p.
    p.h = s  # Sets the headline text of p.
    p.u = aDict # Sets p.u to the given dictionary.

Here is the list of Leo's iterators::

    c.all_nodes             # all vnodes in c.
    c.all_unique_nodes      # all unique vnodes in c.
    c.all_positions         # all positions in c.
    c.all_unique_positions  # all unique positions in c.

    p.children              # all children of p.
    p.following_siblings    # all siblings of p that follow p.
    p.nodes                 # all vnodes in p's subtree.
    p.parents               # all parents of p.
    p.self_and_parents      # p and all parents of p.
    p.siblings              # all siblings of p, including p.
    p.subtree               # all positions in p's subtree, excluding p.
    p.self_and_subtree      # all positions in p's subtree, including p.
    p.unique_nodes          # all unique vnodes in p's subtree.
    p.unique_subtree        # all unique positions in p's subtree.

Plugins
*******

Scripting plugins is exactly like writing Leo scripts,
except that plugins must compute c, g and p as follows:

**g**::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g
    
**c**:

In the top-level init function::

    g.registerHandler(event_name,my_event_handler)

Define event_handler as follows::

    def my_event_handler (kind,keywords):
        c = keywords.get('c'):
        if c:
            ...
   
**p**::

    p = c.p

Using @first
++++++++++++

..  .. index::
    ..  pair: @first; Tutorial

The @first directive forces a lines to appear before the first sentinel of a
external file. For example::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Using @path
+++++++++++

..  .. index::
    ..  pair: @path; Tutorial

Rather than specifying long paths in @file nodes, you can specify a path in
an ancestor @path node.

For example, suppose three nodes have the following headlines::

    @path a
        @path b
            @file c/d.py

Because of the ancestor @path nodes, the @file node creates the file
a/b/c/d.py

Within @path and @<file> paths, {{exp}} gets evaluated with the following
symbols known: c, g, p, os and sys.  For example::

    @file {{os.path.abspath(os.curdir)}}/abc.py

refers to the file abc.py in (absolute path of) the current directory.

Autocompletion
++++++++++++++

Start or stop autocompletions with Alt-1 (toggle-autocompleter)

Leo's autocompletion feature suggests **completions**, text may be valid in
a given point in source code. For example, suppose the cursor follows::

    os.path.os.st
    
The valid completions are all the members of Python's os.path module whose
names start with 'st'. The valid completions appear in a Tab in the Log
Pane.

Leo also shows completions. These completions assume that c is a commander,
g is the leoGlobals object and p is a position.
