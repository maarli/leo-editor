Leo is a power tool for people who want to organize, study and work with
data, especially complex data like computer programs, books, web sites and
data bases. Leonistas say Leo is a revolutionary tool and that Leo is fun
to use--even addictive.

Leo looks like other outlining programs, but it is not. This tutorial
explains the difference. There are four parts, plus a cheatsheet.
Each will take about 30 minutes to read.

The last part is optional, and assumes some familiarity with programming
in `Python`_.
