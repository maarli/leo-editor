Leo 5.6 September 25, 2017

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.6 is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor).

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here](http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

- The cursesGui2.py plugin creates a console gui for Leo.
- Added "Yes to All" and "No to All" buttons to file-changed dialog.
- Improved how Leo switches between git branches.
- Created outline-oriented git-diff command.
